## Druid Overview
### ㅁ Druid's main features
 - Columnar storage format
 - Scalable distributed system
 - Massively parallel processing
 - Realtime or batch ingestion
 - Self-healing, self-balancing, easy to operate
 - Cloud-native, fault-tolerant architecture that won't lose data
 - Indexes for quick filtering
 - Approximate algorithms
 - Automatic summarization at ingest time
 



<br/>
### ㅁ When should I use Druid?
 - Insert rates are very high, but updates are less common. <br/>
 ( 사실 Insert 만 있어야함. update 는 안됌. 모든 Data 는 immutable 한 상태라 보는 것이 맞음 )
 - Most of your queries are aggregation and reporting queries ("group by" queries). You may also have searching and scanning queries. <br/>
 group by, filtering 을 구현하기에 좋다
 - You are targeting query latencies of 100ms to a few seconds. <br/>
( 100ms ~ 수초 이내에 query response 가 요구될 때 )
 - Your data has a time component <br/>
 ( 이것도 필수임 )
